>Hey there!
>Welcome to my pages!

It's me, Etex. I recon a small introduction of myself here wouldn't hurt anybody so I might as well try to make some chit chat. In the Minecraft community you might know me as that one gal who contributed to Realms maps such as: The Naughty List, CONTROL and Slay. Or maybe you've read my name some years ago from a leaderboard on the Hypixel server for TnT tag. Maybe you even were part of the same guild as I at some point. It was fairly large and seasoned in my memory. I'm ashamed to say it would take some effort to remember the name of it now. Those were different times. Either way, I wouldn't really call myself a minecraft fanatic or anything but I believe I know a thing or two after multiple years of service in this game about blocks and how to most effiently arrange them for the release of dopamin in the brain.

On top of the building aspect of the game which first sucked me into creative work I grew interest in the technical side of things. And so I began writing some datapacks realizing I joined at just the right time to dodge the finnicky era of writing code into hundreds or thousands of chained blocks. Pretty neat huh? However having started my education in computer science and programming I can safely say minecraft "programming" is far from ideal. I should probably quit before I start ranting. Below you can read about a couple of datapacks which I have made and think you might enjoy too. So if you're interested in my work dive right in!

## Building Grid

The building grid datapack is primarily designed for creative players with a strong sense of law and order.
I first made this pack for myself because the vast emptiness and lack of constraints in a fresh superflat world is too much to bear.
Amongst other things a building grid helps you plot, design and measure your builds to reach higher sense of control over whatever it is that you're creating. 

Functions of this datapack include:
* Automatic generation of custom floor in a flat minecraft world
* A default "blueprint" pattern designed by me
* Easy floor customization
* A handy chat UI

>That sounds terrific!
